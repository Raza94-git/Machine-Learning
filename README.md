# Machine Learning Projects Repository
Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository showcases a collection of projects that implement various machine learning algorithms to extract insights from data and build predictive models.

# üóÇÔ∏è Repository Overview
In this repository, you will find projects covering a wide range of machine learning algorithms. Each project follows a structured process that includes data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and model building using popular Python libraries and machine learning techniques.

# Key Algorithms Covered:
Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Means Clustering

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Time Series Forecasting

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

# üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

For each project, we begin with a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis:

Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, handling outliers, and transforming variables.

Visualization: Using matplotlib and seaborn to plot graphs and uncover data patterns.

Insights: Gaining a deeper understanding of the data to guide the modeling process.

# üìà Model Building and Evaluation

Once the data is prepared, we employ various modules from Scikit-learn to:

Build predictive models for both classification and regression tasks.

Use dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and LDA.

Cluster data points using K-Means Clustering.

Forecast future trends with Time Series Forecasting.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, and more.
